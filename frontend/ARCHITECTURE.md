# AWS Deploy AI - Architecture Summary

## Simplified Architecture ✅

We successfully **removed the Express server** and simplified the architecture to use **Next.js API routes only**.

### Before (Complex)

```
Frontend (Next.js) → Express Server → MCP Server → AWS Services
```

### After (Simplified)

```
Frontend (Next.js) → Next.js API Routes → MCP Server → AWS Services
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed Express Dependencies

- ❌ Deleted `/server/index.js`
- ❌ Removed `express` from `package.json`
- ✅ Simplified build and start scripts

### 2. Created Next.js API Routes

- ✅ `/api/mcp/route.ts` - Main MCP communication endpoint
- ✅ `/api/health/route.ts` - Health check endpoint
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types and error handling

### 3. Updated Frontend Integration

- ✅ Updated MCP client to use `/api/mcp` endpoint
- ✅ Simplified connection checking
- ✅ Maintained all existing functionality

### 4. Improved Build Process

- ✅ Standard Next.js build process (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Standard Next.js start process (`npm run start`)
- ✅ Development mode works (`npm run dev`)

## Benefits of Simplified Architecture

### ✅ Pros

- **Simpler deployment** - Only need to deploy one Next.js app
- **Easier maintenance** - One less server to manage
- **Standard Next.js patterns** - Follows Next.js best practices
- **Better TypeScript integration** - Full type safety
- **Reduced dependencies** - Fewer packages to manage

### ❌ Trade-offs

- **No real-time updates** - Can't use WebSockets for live deployment progress
- **API route limitations** - Next.js API routes have some constraints
- **Process management** - MCP server lifecycle handled within API routes

## How to Run

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Quick Start

```bash
./start.sh
```

## Next Steps

The application now has a clean, simple architecture that:

1. ✅ Connects to GitHub repositories
2. ✅ Analyzes project types
3. ✅ Communicates with MCP server for deployments
4. ✅ Provides a beautiful UI for the deployment process
5. ✅ Uses standard Next.js patterns

**The architecture is production-ready and much easier to deploy and maintain!** 🚀
